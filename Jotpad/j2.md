To tackle this assignment effectively, you'll need to break down the requirements and plan your development process step-by-step. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you build the school website using React.js and other specified technologies:

### 1. Project Setup
- **Create a new React application** using Create React App.
- **Install necessary packages**: `react-router-dom` for routing, `redux` or `react-context` for state management, and a CSS framework like `bootstrap` or `tailwindcss`.
- Set up a basic folder structure (e.g., components, pages, assets).

### 2. Design and Layout
- **Sketch out a wireframe** or use a design tool like Figma to plan the UI/UX.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure your design is mobile-first and adapts well to different screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Plan for keyboard navigability and screen reader support from the start.

### 3. Development
#### Home Page
- **Navbar**: Include links to all sections.
- **Carousel/Banner**: Implement using a library like `react-slick` or `swiper`.
- **Quick Links**: Cards or buttons that redirect to other sections.

#### About Us
- **Text Content**: Use the provided history, vision, mission, and principal's message.
- **Layout**: Consider columns or cards for different sections.

#### Academics
- **Curriculum Details**: Use tabs or accordion components for different grades and streams.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Depending on user selection, show relevant information.

#### Admissions
- **Forms**: Use `formik` or `react-hook-form` for form handling with validation.
- **Downloadable Forms**: Provide links to download PDFs.

#### Faculty
- **Profiles**: Display using a grid layout. Consider a modal for detailed profiles.

#### Students
- **Extracurricular Activities and Achievements**: Use lists or cards.
- **Student Council**: Highlight leadership using a dedicated section.

#### Gallery
- **Filterable Gallery**: Implement filters using buttons or a dropdown.
- **Lightbox for Images**: Use a library like `react-image-lightbox`.

#### Contact Us
- **Form**: Implement with validation and feedback on submission.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Use the Google Maps API or an iframe for location.

### 4. State Management
- Use Redux for global state management (e.g., user-submitted form data, gallery filters).
- Use local state with React Hooks for local component states.

### 5. Routing
- Set up routes using `react-router-dom`.
- Ensure that the navigation is smooth and user-friendly.

### 6. Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement for images and heavy components.
- **Code Splitting**: Use dynamic `import()` for splitting code at the route level.

### 7. Testing and Validation
- **Accessibility Checks**: Use tools like Axe or Lighthouse.
- **Responsive Testing**: Test on various devices and viewports.
- **Performance Testing**: Check load times and optimize as necessary.

### 8. Deployment
- **GitHub**: Push your code to a GitHub repository.
- **Deployment**: Use Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages to deploy your site.
- **README**: Document setup instructions, dependencies, and any necessary environment variables.

### 9. Submission
- Ensure all requirements are met and the website is fully functional.
- Submit your repository and live site link through the provided submission link.

### Additional Tips
- **Version Control**: Make regular commits with clear messages.
- **Feedback**: Get feedback on usability and design from peers or mentors.
- **Documentation**: Comment your code where necessary and maintain a clean codebase.

This structured approach should help you manage the development process efficiently and meet all the specified requirements for the school website project. Good luck!
