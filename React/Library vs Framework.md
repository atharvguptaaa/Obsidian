### Differences :
**Control**: With libraries, you call the code when you need it. With frameworks, the framework calls your code when it needs it.
**Scope**: Libraries are typically used for specific tasks like sending HTTP requests or manipulating the DOM. Frameworks provide a more holistic approach, offering tools and guidelines for the entire project.
**Integration**: Integrating a library into a project is generally simpler and less invasive, whereas using a framework often requires adopting certain programming paradigms and structures dictated by the framework.

Examples of libraries: jQuery, Lodash, React (often considered both a library and a framework depending on how it's used).
Examples of frameworks: Angular, Django, Ruby on Rails.

### Case for React
React is typically referred to as a "library" because of its primary focus on UI, component-based modular approach and **flexibility in integration with projects on other frameworks** such as Angular, Vue, Django etc. 
However, when combined with other tools and libraries from its ecosystem(e.g. Redux, React Router, Next.js), it can provide a framework-like experience, supporting **full application development** and adhering to established conventions and best practices. This dual nature is why React can be seen both as a library and a framework, depending on the context of its use.
