- JavaScript is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous concurrent language.

- It has a call stack, an event loop, and a callback queue + other APIs.

* [[Misc JS#V8 Engine]] compiles JS code into native machine code before executing it.

* The **heap** is used for memory allocation, and the **stack** holds the execution context.

* DOM, setTimeout, XMLHttpRequest don't exist in V8 source code.
